	<h1>Common Exercises</h1>
	<p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine: </p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Burpees</dt>
		<dd>Burpees are an awesome, full body exercise to increase your stegth and endurance. Being in a standing position, then drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.
		<br></dd>
		
		<dt>Plank</dt>
		<dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can for maximum results.
		<br></dd>
		
		<dt>Mountain Climbers</dt>
		<dd>Mountain Climbers are a great cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your chest and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).
		<br></dd>
